# AI-Assignments
Java implementations of AI search algorithms


This repository contains a collection of Artificial Intelligence assignments implemented in Java.
The tasks focus on classical search algorithms used in problem-solving and path-finding, including:

-Depth-First Search (DFS)

-Breadth-First Search (BFS)

-Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

-A* Search

-Iterative Deepening search (IDS)

-Depth Limited Search (DLS) 


Each assignment includes:

-Java implementation of the algorithm

-Graph representation using adjacency matrix

-User input for selecting start and goal nodes

-Printed output showing the resulting path

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate an understanding of how different search strategies explore graphs, compare their behavior, and analyze their correctness and performance.

this repository also includes an assignment called Neuron, which implements a simple artificial neuron trained to reproduce the AND gate output using iterative weight adjustments. The assignment further requires implementing additional logic gates (OR, NAND, NOR) and experimentally demonstrating why XOR cannot be implemented using a single neuron
